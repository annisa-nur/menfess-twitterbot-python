this codes take a reference from https://github.com/ydhnwb/autodm_base

I add some new fiture, such as:

1. making a thread
2. deleting messages which attach GIF
3. Insensitive keyword
4. tweet with 4 photo

in order to avoid error: code H14 No Web Processes Running when you deploy it to heroku or the other hosting server,
I suggest you to add some codes with module flask to make a route so that it can be run in web server.

How to run the codes :
1. Download it as a zip and extract to your directory.
2. Open it in editor and dowload the package/module that needed or you can try to open cmd first then go to your directory and then install the requirements.txt with pip install -r requirements.txt 
3. try to run the codes.
